<p>#I’m also an anime coser</p>
<p>Cosplay involves dressing up as a character, often from video games or comics. But there’s a key difference to your standard dress-up in the word itself: you also actually play that character.
In cosplay, a good costume is as much about creativity with materials and construction as it is about the outcome.</p>
