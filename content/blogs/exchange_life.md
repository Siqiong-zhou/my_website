title: Exchange Life in Canada
---
I went to University of British Colombia in Canada in 2019 as an exchange student.
I spent four months there and it is an unforgettable experience for me. The interesting thing is that, the friend I made in Canada is now living with me in London and both of us are LBS MFA students.
